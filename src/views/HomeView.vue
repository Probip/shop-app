      <p class="text-lg">Everything we make is built on sustainably-sourced fruits and vegetables and crafted into delicious food that is actually good for you. We‚Äôre frozen for a reason‚Äîbecause our method means more nutrients, better flavor, and food that keeps up with the pace of your life. And‚Äîwhen you're juggling way more than you think you can, or you're taking the night off‚Äîour food is delivered to you and ready in minutes.</p>

      <img :src="getImage('img6.jpg')" alt="" class="col-span-2 rounded-lg mb-12" />
      <p class="text-lg">We freeze our ingredients at peak ripeness, typically within 24 hours of harvest, to lock in flavor and nutrients, reduce food waste, and eradicate the need for additives or harmful preservatives. This way, our food is always ready when you are.
        Speaking of wins, even a small commitment to eat less of the other stuff and more fruits + veggies can cut your carbon footprint by a third.
